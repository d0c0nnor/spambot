* Introduction

This is the code base for the 'Warm Spam' project completed as part of
the [[http://www.thedigitalsizzle.com/][Digital Sizzle Art/Data hackathon 2012.]]

The premise of the project was to capture people reading spam messages
and to play back the recordings in a gallery context.

To that end it consisted of the following: 

- A spam collector service that collected spam from [[mailinator.com]] 
- A website that used the Twillio API to capture recordings
- A Pure Data program that generated a radio station based on the
  captured recordings.
