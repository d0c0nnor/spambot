    <p>Welcome to the <strong>warm spam</strong> project, part of the <a href="http://www.thedigitalsizzle.com/">Digital Sizzle 2012
      hackathon.</a></p>

    <p>This project has two parts. A website, that collects
    recordings of people reading spam messages, and a
    radio station, where those recordings are made into something
    beautiful by combining them with an algorithmic composition by the guys
    at <a href="http://reactifymusic.com">Reactify</a>

      <p>If you would like to participate, and have you're voice heard
      saying potentially naughty things in the Whitechapel Gallery on
      September 26th, you will need a phone and a seperate screen from
      which to read the piece of spam that you're going to record.
